    "Abstraction refers to the process of hiding the internal implementation details of system and shows only relevant essential features and functionalities to users. Abstraction is an outer layout, used in terms of design. It solves the problem in design level. It is achieved through abstract classes and interfaces. It hides complexity i.e the irrelevant details found in the code.\n",

    "Encapsulation, whereas, refers to process of wrapping data and methods that work with data in one unit for necessary information. Encapsulation is inner layout, used in terms of implementation. It solves problem on implementation level. It is achieved through the use of access modifiers like public, private and protected. It helps developers to organize the entire code easily."
